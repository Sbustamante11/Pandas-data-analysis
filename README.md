# Overview

The data set being used for this project is from Amazon. It is a customer's purchase history across their account.
The data set goes back two years to the year 2020. It includes all purchases with their respective order information.
This data set includes order date, order ID, unique UNSPSC code, list price of item, plus all information related to the order, etc.

Data source: the data was provided from Amazon.com, from a personal Amazon customer's account.
 
As a software engineer the purpose for writing this software was to use the Pandas library in Python to analyze data. In addition, data science 
and the value of data in the 21st century is an invaluable asset. This software explores data science while simultaneously building a foundation for
the tools used to perform data analysis in Python. The software specifically analyzes the spending history of an Amazon customer. Through using the pandas library
we can evaluate spending trends, types of purchases, and survey habits of the average consumer.
